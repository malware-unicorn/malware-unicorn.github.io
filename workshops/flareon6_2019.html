        <p>Every year the Flare team puts on a reverse engineering CTF called the <a href="http://www.flare-on.com" target="_blank">Flare-On Challenge</a>. These challenges are loosely based off malware and techniques that are seen in malware. The nice thing about these challenges is that it helps folks like me to keep my skills sharp. Majority of these challenges are heavily windows based, so unless you have a Windows VM, debugging can be tough. Usually most can be solved with just using IDA pro or Ghidra without needing to debug anything.</p>
<p>All flags are suffixed with &#34;@flare-on.com&#34; which is very helpful in finding flags are encrypted.</p>
<p>In this walk-through I will assume that the first 4 challenges are for new reverse engineers and will be over-explaining a bit. The rest should be more high level for keeping the length down.</p>

<h2 is-upgraded>Summary</h2>
<p>This is a simple .NET GUI program that uses a simple byte XOR based on the modulo length of the string created by the name of the weapons you choose.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Tools to use</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy/releases" target="_blank">Dnspy </a>or ILSpy</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hasherezade/pe-bear-releases/releases" target="_blank">PE Bear</a> (alternatives: CFF explorer, PE studio)</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Challenge Text</h2>
<pre><code>Memecat Battlestation [Shareware Demo Edition]
Welcome to the Sixth Flare-On Challenge!
The 7zip password is: flare
This is a simple game. Reverse engineer it to figure out what &#34;weapon codes&#34; you need to enter to defeat each of the two enemies and the victory screen will reveal the flag. Enter the flag here on this site to score and move on to the next level.
This challenge is written in .NET. If you don&#39;t already have a favorite .NET reverse engineering tool I recommend dnSpy</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Getting Started</h2>
<p>With any new binary you receive be sure triage and handle with care. While these CTFs are generally good natured, never trust any binary and examine in a Virtual Machine. Use a hex editor, binwalk, or the <em>file</em> command on your *nix shell to determine the file type. Use PE Bear, CFF explorer, or PE studio to help you identify what kind of PE binary it could be.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Program</h2>
<p>After opening in Dnspy you can see that there are 3 forms to actually care about. If you haven&#39;t made a GUI .NET form program before, I highly recommend coding up one yourself. To put it in plain words, each form class acts like a scene in the GUI which means each class has several visual properties that reference objects in the resources (MemcatBattelstation.Properties). When working with malware, the resources of a .NET program is a great place to start looking for clues.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Victory Form</h2>
<p>In the main program, there are references to the form classes: stage1, stage2, and VictoryForm. The constructor for the victory form is taking in a string concatenated from strings returned from stage1 and stage2. When the VictoryForm is constructed it loads the encoded flag as a byte array of 31 integers. The constructor string was used to decode the encoded byte array using a simple XOR routine. </p>
<pre><code>Application.Run(new VictoryForm
{
        Arsenal = string.Join(&#34;,&#34;, new string[]
        {
                stage2Form.WeaponCode,
                stage1Form.WeaponCode
        }),
        Location = stage2Form.Location
});</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Stage 1</h2>
<p>Since this is a game that requires you to enter in a weapon name, the next step is finding out what those weapon names are. The form class should have an event function associated with the button click. This takes in a string which becomes very obvious with the IF statement.</p>
<p>So at this point, the Stage 1 form is looking for a string RAINBOW as the weapon name. There is a dank animation afterwards.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 447.50px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/94facda6220dcc64.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Stage 2</h2>
<p>The second stage becomes a little bit tricky, but like I said the clues are in the resource section. You can use deductive reasoning to guess which image objects haven&#39;t been referenced yet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rainbowlaser (Stage 1)</li>
<li>Bagels</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing that the answer is using both stage1 and stage2 weapon code combined we already know part of the key. Can also assume that the end of the 31 byte array ends with &#34;@flare-on.com&#34;. There is also a function call isValidWeaponCode that verifies if the string matches the hard coded sequence shown below. The isValidWeaponCode function pretty much takes out the guesswork.</p>
<pre><code>private bool isValidWeaponCode(string s)
{
        char[] array = s.ToCharArray();
        int length = s.Length;
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++)
        {
                char[] array2 = array;
                int num = i;
                array2[num] ^= &#39;A&#39;;
        }
        return array.SequenceEqual(new char[]
        {
                &#39;\u0003&#39;,
                &#39; &#39;,
                &#39;&amp;&#39;,
                &#39;$&#39;,
                &#39;-&#39;,
                &#39;\u001e&#39;,
                &#39;\u0002&#39;,
                &#39; &#39;,
                &#39;/&#39;,
                &#39;/&#39;,
                &#39;.&#39;,
                &#39;/&#39;
        });
}</code></pre>
<p>In the end you are left with:</p>
<pre><code>RAINBOWBagel_Cannon</code></pre>
<p>It&#39;s all downhill from that point. The following function is used to decode the integer array.</p>
<pre><code>byte[] bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(this.Arsenal);
for (int i = 0; i &lt; array.Length; i++)
{
        byte[] array2 = array;
        int num = i;
        array2[num] ^= bytes[i % bytes.Length];
}
this.flagLabel.Text = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(array);</code></pre>
<p>And then you get another dank animation.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 428.91px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/48f8918515f4d42.png"></p>
<p>The flag will be revealed after that.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 427.50px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/2187f8c5b893d169.png"></p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Challenge 2 - Overlong" duration="0">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Summary</h2>
<p>This is a simple Windows x32 PE program that decrypts the flag within a loop that never triggers. You will need to either patch the program or modify the branch flags in the debugger to advance.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Tools to use</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hasherezade/pe-bear-releases/releases" target="_blank">PE Bear</a> (alternatives: CFF explorer, PE studio)</li>
<li>IDA (alternatives: Ghidra, Radare2)</li>

</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Challenge Text</h2>
<pre><code>Overlong
1
The secret of this next challenge is cleverly hidden. However, with the right approach, finding the solution will not take an overlong amount of time.
*The 7zip password is: flare</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Identifying the problem</h2>
<p>In a disassembler, offset 0x117E is where the function decides to loop through the encoded text. Using the graph mode in your disassembler will help you see the loop designated by the blue arrow lines. The branch statement is where you will want to modify in the debugger.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/e66ecb36b7a11c11.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Modifying the Control Flow</h2>
<p>In x32dbg, you can patch instructions. In this case, I did not want to take the branch jump so it was easier just to &#34;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_(code)" target="_blank">nop</a>&#34; out the instruction altogether. Be sure to fill the rest of the bytes with nops.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/b45f93631ea34f56.png"></p>
<p>Typically in byte arrays that are being processed, the byte needs to be moved from a register to a memory address. It&#39;s easier to find a <code>mov [address], register</code> instruction (intel syntax) as a quicker way to find the destination.</p>
<p>In x32dbg, if you right click on the destination address within the instruction and you can view that address in the dump window as seen below. After you have patched the instructions, you can continue to run the program and it will reveal the flag.</p>

<h2 is-upgraded>Summary</h2>
<p>This is a Tamagotchi themed android apk that uses simple math to decrypt the flag. The math product is calculated by the inputs of playing, feeding, and cleaning poop.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Tools to use</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/" target="_blank">Apktool</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pxb1988/dex2jar/releases" target="_blank">dex2jar</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/java-decompiler/jd-gui" target="_blank">Jd-gui</a> (alternatives: <a href="https://www.pnfsoftware.com/" target="_blank">JEB Decompiler</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.android.com/studio" target="_blank">Android studio</a> (mainly to use the emulators)</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Challenge Text</h2>
<pre><code>Flarebear
1
We at Flare have created our own Tamagotchi pet, the flarebear. He is very fussy. Keep him alive and happy and he will give you the flag.
7Zip password: flare</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Deconstructing an APK</h2>
<p>The apktool does a good job at getting you the file you need the most which is the classes.dex file which is a Dalvik executable. The command below should do the trick.</p>
<pre><code>apktool d flarebear.apk</code></pre>
<p>Next you will need to convert the dex file into a jar to that you can decompile with a java decompiler tool. Using dex2jar should help with that. </p>
<pre><code>d2j-dex2jar.sh -f ~/path/to/classes.dex</code></pre>
<p>Once you have the jar file in my case classes-dex2jar.jar, you can use the tool jd-gui to decompile the jar.</p>
<pre><code>java -j jd-gui.jar</code></pre>
<p>Finally download an emulator from Android studio, using Tools-&gt;SDK Manager-&gt;Android SDK-&gt;SDK Tools Tab-&gt;Android Emulator. Under Tools-&gt;AVD Manager is where you can manage all the android virtual machines for debugging the APK. You can open the original APK in Android studio and debug with the emulator/AVD build you downloaded. At this point you have the java classes loaded in jd-gui and the flarebear.apk running in the emulator from android studio.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Identifying the Problem</h2>
<p>Android malware can sometimes hide binary data in the APK &#34;raw&#34; resources. In the raw folder from the apktool dump, files named &#34;ecstatic&#34; and &#34;estatic2&#34; are highly suspicious. It will be useful to trace these filenames in the code: ecstatic -&gt; openRawResource -&gt;danceWithFlag-&gt;isEcstatic-&gt;setMood.</p>
<p>In debugging in android studio has a window you can view the values of the password for the decrypt function. You&#39;ll notice that the password is built from the string created from the combination of inputs.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/6b51bcd2f22c535.png"></p>
<p>The next step is to determine how the input relates to the functions. In FlarebearActivity.java, there are isHappy and IsEstatic functions that precede the decryption of final flag image in function danceWithFlag.</p>
<pre><code>public final void setMood() {
    if (isHappy()) {
      ((ImageView)_$_findCachedViewById(R.id.flareBearImageView)).setTag(&#34;happy&#34;);
      if (isEcstatic()) {
        danceWithFlag();
        return;
      }
    } else {
      ((ImageView)_$_findCachedViewById(R.id.flareBearImageView)).setTag(&#34;sad&#34;);
    }
  }</code></pre>
<p>The actions play, feed, and poop accumulate mass, happy, and clean values. In the function <code>isEcstatic</code> these values tested against hard coded integers. Figuring out the combination becomes a simple math problem that you can do by hand.</p>
<pre><code>public final boolean isEcstatic() {
    byte b = 0;
    int i = getState(&#34;mass&#34;, 0);
    int j = getState(&#34;happy&#34;, 0);
    int k = getState(&#34;clean&#34;, 0);
    int m = b;
    if (i == 72) {
      m = b;
      if (j == 30) {
        m = b;
        if (k == 0)
          m = 1;
      }
    }
    return m;
  }</code></pre>
<p>Using the emulator you can plug in 8 feeds, 4 plays, 2 cleans and it will decrypt an image from the resources to reveal the flag.</p>

<h2 is-upgraded>Summary</h2>
<p>This challenge has 2 x64 ELF binaries that utilizes the DNS requests as inputs for determining the next move on a chess board.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Tools to use</h2>
<ul>
<li>IDA</li>
<li>Linux x64 VM</li>

Some suspicious network traffic led us to this unauthorized chess program running on an Ubuntu desktop. This appears to be the work of cyberspace computer hackers. You&#39;ll need to make the right moves to solve this one. Good luck!
7Zip password: flare</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Identifying the Problem</h2>
<p>Some malware and RAT kits can use DNS requests as a form of communication to the command and control node. ChessUI binary serves just as the UI for the chessboard while ChessAI.so is the library that calculates the next chess moves based off of the DNS responses. The Flare team likes to take you down rabbit holes when the solution is very simple.</p>
<p>In ChessAI.so the function <code>getNextMove</code> takes the values from the DNS requests and converts them for positions on the chessboard. The if statement <code>if ( *v10 != 127 || v10[3] &amp; 1 || a1 != (v10[2] &amp; 0xF))</code>was the most obvious clue in that it is looking for 127 like in 127.0.0.1. So I just need to make sure when I replay packets that the IP addresses contain these values. Easy peasy.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 573.00px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/7b2f68f414fc700c.png"></p>
<p>I was too lazy to stand up a DNS tool to replay the pcap so instead I just changed my /etc/hosts file on my ubuntu vm to match. I used tshark to grep all the IP addresses and domain names.</p>
<pre><code>tshark -r capture.pcap -T fields -e dns.a -e dns.qry.name -2 -R &#34;dns.flags.response eq 1&#34;</code></pre>

<p>The next easy step was to just take all the values from the DNS request and plug them into the gameboard. As an example the DNS request <code>rook-c3-c6.game-of-thrones.flare-on.com</code> is to move rook from position c3 to c6 on the chess board. </p>
<p>Simple right? But wait there&#39;s more!</p>
<p>Turns out that the order of the DNS request are not sequential. The other parts of the IP address dedupes and numbers the order of the requests: <code>v10[3] &amp; 1</code> and <code>a1 != (v10[2] &amp; 0xF).</code></p>

<h2 is-upgraded>Shrunken PE Header</h2>
<p>Always use a PE header parser like CFF explorer or PE Bear to verify the that the header looks correct. I had found that this header seemed to be smaller than normal and lacked a section table.

<h2 is-upgraded>Identifying the Problem</h2>
<p>I think I spent majority of this challenge reading up on DirectX 3D programs. I didn&#39;t even know what a &#34;demo&#34; was until I had to find the term in gaming pop culture articles. The best way I can describe it is like a graphic designer showing off their portfolio pieces. The best resource I could find on was on <a href="https://github.com/GameHackingBook/GameHackingCode/blob/master/Chapter8_Direct3DApplication/main.cpp" target="_blank">Game Hacking from Nick Cano</a>. This resource helped explained how to manipulate 3D meshes and 3D Matrix translations. </p>
<p>I found that there were 2 3D meshes that were being placed on the plane. The first mesh being the Flare logo and the unknown second mesh. <code>D3DXMatrixTranslation</code> function controlled how those meshes were displayed. If you ever worked with Blender or Autodesk Maya before you know that there are 3 positions: X, Y, and Z. </p>
<pre><code>D3DXMATRIX* D3DXMatrixTranslation(
  _Inout_ D3DXMATRIX *pOut,
  _In_    FLOAT      x,
  _In_    FLOAT      y,
  _In_    FLOAT      z
);</code></pre>
<p>Remember that arguments are pushed onto the stack backwards starting with Z, Y, X. The Z position was grossly out of proportion at 0x3FAAAAAB. So this position is way off the camera view. If you patched the instruction or changed the value on the stack to 0, it will render the second mesh will be displayed in front of the Flare logo.</p>

<h2 is-upgraded>Summary</h2>
<p>This is a .NET executable that uses the most significant bit steganography to hide an image within another image. This challenge also uses IL code modification to edit values of function offsets and immediate values.</p>

<h2 is-upgraded>A little bit about .NET</h2>
<p>Like any other higher level language, .NET is built on something called IL code or Intermediate Language code. The code that you write is converted into unique identifiers that used to find functions, strings, etc in a giant look up table. You can find this table in the .NET header, it&#39;s called the Metadata Table. This is good to know if you decide to one day do .NET JIT function hooking or IL code modification, but for this challenge you&#39;ll need to identify when something is changed. Luckily Dnspy as a nice feature to help with this.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Anti-Tampering</h2>
<p>The init function is making sure that functions <code>a, b, c, d</code> haven&#39;t been tampered with. Instead of using the names of the function it uses the Method Identifier to determine which function bodies to verify. It will also swap function <code>a</code> with function <code>b</code> and function <code>c</code> with function <code>d</code>.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>IL Code modification</h2>
<p>The same init function also calls a function to <code>CalculateStack</code>. If you follow this function down to <code>IdentifyLocals-&gt;IncrementStack</code> functions, you&#39;ll find that the function h body had been modified to swap function f with function g. </p>
<p>If you right click on the h function in Dnspy you can view the method body in a hex editor. This will help determine what bytes are actually being modified. Luckily Dnspy already converts function identifiers in to hex, which is easy to spot in the hex editor.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 461.00px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/399d95c45c921cb7.png"></p>

<h2 is-upgraded>Creating Inverse Functions</h2>
<p>The Flare team really likes you to go down rabbit holes. It may look like it&#39;s using some kind of RC4 but it&#39;s doing some simple math functions. These functions you can easily create inverses for. So functions b,d,e, h and i will need to be written as inverse functions meaning f(x) = y and g(y) = x. Excuse my shitty c# code.</p>

We used our own computer hacking skills to &#34;find&#34; this AI on a military supercomputer. It does strongly resemble the classic 1983 movie WarGames. Perhaps life imitates art? If you can find the launch codes for us, we&#39;ll let you pass to the next challenge. We promise not to start a thermonuclear war.

<h2 is-upgraded>The War Games movie</h2>
<p>I hadn&#39;t watched War Games in a long time, so I decided to look up some clues and dialog. I saw that the launch code are all upper case letters and numbers: <code>DLG2209TVX.</code> My next assumption is that maybe these codes will look similar (all uppercase).</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Identifying PyInstaller</h2>
<p>Looking at the disassembly there is a reference to the string &#34;_MEIPASS2&#34;. From my experience looking at py2exe and pyinstaller malware I was able to quickly identify that this string is related to pyinstaller. This string represents the offset of code that contains the python bytecode.</p>

<h2 is-upgraded>Extracting Python Code</h2>
<p>Luckily there is a tool out there to extract the pyc or python compiled bytecode. I used PyInstaller Extractor.</p>

<p>Once you have the extracted folder, you&#39;ll notice that it is using Python37.dll. Going forward you will want to install this version to decompile. Now there are 2 entrypoints dumped by the extractor. The file <code>pyiboot02_cleanup</code> is the file to decompile.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Decompiling Python Code</h2>
<p>The header is stripped in <code>pyiboot02_cleanup</code>. Uncompyle6 requires that the correct header is present. Using python37 in Windows, compile a random python file so that you can copy it&#39;s pyc header. I noticed that Macos and Windows pyc headers are different. So whichever you used to compile Uncompyle6, and you should use the same OS and version of python37. The following command should to the trick.</p>
<pre><code>python37 -m compileall .</code></pre>
<p>This was my header:</p>

<h2 is-upgraded>Decrypting More Python Code</h2>
<p>Now that you have the decompiled python code, there is another layer of python code that needs to be decrypted. The &#34;_doc_&#34; which is the Shakespeare text at the beginning of the file contains the compressed and encrypted python code. You will need to extract out the _doc_ bytes from the original pyc file because the bytes existing between lines are actually the bytes used to RC4 decrypt (fire() function). </p>
<p>Next a key file is read from the folder that&#39;s obviously named &#34;key&#34;. A for loop that ranges from 0 to 256 while add 1 byte (<code>bytes([74])</code>) to the beginning of the key. It uses a try catch to handle any failures so it&#39;s hard to identify which one actually worked.</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(256):
    try:
        exec(lzma.decompress(fire(eye(__doc__.encode()), bytes([i]) + BOUNCE)))
    except Exception as e:
        pass</code></pre>
<p>The Flare team does a sneaky function switch by swapping <code>print</code> and <code>exec</code> functions. So when there is a successful decompression, it will continue to execute the decompressed python code without throwing an error.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Main Python Code</h2>
<p>You will still need x32dbg for this next part. In the function wrong, it acquires the handle to its own process in memory. </p>
<pre><code>trust = windll.kernel32.GetModuleHandleW(None)</code></pre>
<p>This means you will need to work with the process memory offsets as they exist post ntdll loading.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 346.06px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/317f2b23d2a0c6aa.png"></p>
<p>You can dump and modify the python code so that it will take a bin file instead of actually getting a handle to the process memory.</p>
<pre><code>with open(&#34;wopr_01000000.bin&#34;, &#34;rb&#34;) as bin:
        wopr_addr = 0x1000000
        binbytes = bin.read()
        pbinbytes = c_char_p(binbytes)
        computer = string_at(pbinbytes, 1024)</code></pre>
<p>It will generate a md5 hash from processing this memory. This hash is xored with an integer array.</p>
<pre><code>xor = [212, 162, 242, 218, 101, 109, 50, 31, 125, 112, 249, 83, 55, 187, 131, 206]
h = [hash[i] ^ xor[i] for i in range(16)]
//output:
h = [115, 29, 32, 68, 106, 108, 89, 76, 21, 71, 78, 51, 75, 1, 55, 102]</code></pre>
<p>The xored hash is product is used to verify the launch codes (<code>b == h</code>) with the following:</p>

<h2 is-upgraded>Using Z3 Theorem Solver</h2>
<p>I was too lazy to do solve the rest of this by hand, so my work CTF buddy suggested I used Z3. If you decide to install Z3 on a Mac you will need to compile the source code. Remember the launch codes are all uppercase letters and numbers. Here is my simple python z3 script that solved the puzzle.</p>

<h2 is-upgraded>Summary</h2>
<p>An old NES game that has a simple patch to get to the flag scene.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Tools to use</h2>
<ul>
<li>fceux emulator</li>
<li>IDA (alternatives: Ghidra, Radare2)</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Challenge Text</h2>
<pre><code>snake
1
The Flare team is attempting to pivot to full-time twitch streaming video games instead of reverse engineering computer software all day. We wrote our own classic NES game to stream content that nobody else has seen and watch those subscribers flow in. It turned out to be too hard for us to beat so we gave up. See if you can beat it and capture the internet points that we failed to collect.</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>NES resources</h2>
<p>Now I anticipated that there was going to be an NES challenge based on one of Nick Harbour&#39;s tweets. Luckily fceux emulator is all that you really needed for this challenge:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 395.00px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/4b8f882bb6dfe43.png"></p>
<p>I didn&#39;t know anything about reversing NES games prior to this challenge. But any assembly language is just like any other assembly language and is easy to pick up. Looking up past NES CTF writeups and NESdev wiki was what I found most useful:</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Tools" target="_blank">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Tools</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_nametables" target="_blank">https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_nametables</a></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>PPU Nametables</h2>
<p>So reading other CTF challenges gave me a clue to look at the PPU tables for any interesting information. I see that the tiled images of characters would probably be the flag. The next step is to find out how they are mapped and hardcoded in the NES code.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 557.50px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/ee13a00fe651111.png"></p>
<p>I probably spent way too much time learning about NES reversing than actually solving the challenge. IDA mac doesn&#39;t really have a great NES plugin precompiled but as long as you use M6502 microprocessor when you load the bin file it should be fine. Here is what I used as an instruction resource <a href="http://obelisk.me.uk/6502/reference.html" target="_blank">http://obelisk.me.uk/6502/reference.html</a></p>
<p>In your disassembler be sure to rebase the image to 0xC000 and change the entrypoint to 0x10. At the end of the NES binary is where all the data is stored to display the tiles from the PPU tables. </p>
<p>When the snake is changing position, the assembly compares (CMP) the contents of the accumulator register at offset 0xC300. If you patch the branch instruction at offset 0xC302 to a JMP it will force the control flow to continue on to display the flag.</p>

<p>A broken header x32 Windows PE that has some Rick-Rolling and Anti-Debugging fun.</p>

7zip password: flare</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Identifying the Problem</h2>
<p>Luckily the challenge text gave a really good hint as to what was broken about it. Typically disassemblers fail when there is an unexpected value being processed such as addresses being processed as an integer rather than an unsigned integer. I had guessed right off the bat that Ghidra was having a header parser issue and I was right.</p>
<p>The ghidra log was throwing this error. <img style="width: 624.00px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/488f99f8fa8d1a1d.png"></p>
<p>I went to go check the source code at the link below. And it was improperly handling the header base addressing. <a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/5e593cb4ae18903b053ac4c84664ee3c632bd95f/Ghidra/Features/Base/src/main/java/ghidra/app/util/opinion/PeLoader.java#L313" target="_blank">https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/5e593cb4ae18903b053ac4c84664ee3c632bd95f/Ghidra/Features/Base/src/main/java/ghidra/app/util/opinion/PeLoader.java#L313</a></p>
<pre><code>AddressRange brddRange =
                        new AddressRangeImpl(space.getAddress(originalImageBase + brdd.getVirtualAddress()),
                                space.getAddress(originalImageBase + brdd.getVirtualAddress() + brdd.getSize()));</code></pre>
<p>Luckily IDA doesn&#39;t have this same problem but you can always change the base image to a normal address like 0x400000.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 215.62px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/d5a6c047b9e2927b.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Some Rick-Rolling</h2>
<p>When you use a debugger it takes you down a path that seems way too simple to be the solution. A simple if statement that you can easily do by hand and the key. </p>
<pre><code>if ((((((iVar3 == 0xb) &amp;&amp; (pcVar2[1] == &#39;o&#39;)) &amp;&amp; (((int)pcVar2[2] &amp; 0xfffffffU) == 0x54)) &amp;&amp;
     ((pcVar2[10] == &#39;G&#39; &amp;&amp; ((byte)~pcVar2[7] == 0xad)))) &amp;&amp;
    (((byte)(pcVar2[4] ^ pcVar2[3]) == 0x41 &amp;&amp;
     (((int)*pcVar2 * 3 - 0xf6U &lt; 2 &amp;&amp; ((int)pcVar2[8] * 0xc800 - 0x520800U &lt; 3)))))) &amp;&amp;
   ((pcVar2[6] == &#39;e&#39; &amp;&amp; (((pcVar2[5] &amp; 1U) == 0 &amp;&amp; (pcVar2[9] == &#39;n&#39;)))))) {
  uVar4 = 0;</code></pre>
<p>Obviously it presents you with a fake flag.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/1423e45591540770.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Some Anti-Debugging</h2>
<p>If you throw the binary in a Hex editor there is a dead give away of where executable code might be placed. All the 0x90 nops are highly suspicious.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/20c9e8248515a990.png"></p>
<p>Before main is even called, there is bootstrap code that sets up crt libs and arguments. At offset 0x1A4A is a call to <code>___scrt_is_nonwritable_in_current_image</code>. You will want to stepover this function or modify the branch at 0x1A52 to continue to the call to esi at 0x1A62 and step into. This is where the 0x90 nops are filled in with new code.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/84ddee6ea6aa086e.png"></p>
<p>Add another breakpoint at offset 0x15AD to get past the performance time checks.</p>
<p>I was able to extract out the bytes that were placed in that section and just patched the binary at offset 0x6D0 so that I could view it casually in IDA and Ghidra.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>The Actual Solution</h2>
<p>The following code is actually what is decrypting the key:</p>
<pre><code>_Buf = (char *)calloc(0xe,1);
                /* Call print */
FUN_004016a0(&#34;Enter key: &#34;,uVar15);
_File = (FILE *)__acrt_iob_func(0);
fgets(_Buf,0xe,_File);
_Buf[0xd] = 0;
cVar2 = *_Buf;
iVar8 = 0;
cVar3 = cVar2;
while (cVar3 != 0) {
  iVar8 = iVar8 + 1;
  cVar3 = _Buf[iVar8];
}
if (_Buf[iVar8 + -1] == &#39;\n&#39;) {
  iVar8 = 0;
  while (cVar2 != 0) {
    iVar8 = iVar8 + 1;
    cVar2 = _Buf[iVar8];
  }
  _Buf[iVar8 + -1] = 0;
}
uVar11 = 0;
cVar2 = *_Buf;
while (cVar2 != 0) {
  uVar11 = uVar11 + 1;
  cVar2 = _Buf[uVar11];
}
uVar6 = 0;
do {
  uVar9 = uVar6;
  abStack280[uVar9] = _Buf[uVar9 % uVar11] ^ *(byte *)((int)&amp;local_160 + uVar9);
  uVar6 = uVar9 + 1;
} while (uVar9 + 1 &lt; 0x35);
abStack280[uVar9] = 0;
if (uVar9 + 1 &lt; 0x100) {
  abStack280[uVar9 + 1] = 0;
  _Buf = strstr((char *)abStack280,&#34;@flare-on.com&#34;);
  if (_Buf == (char *)0x0) {
    FUN_004016a0(&#34;\nERROR: Wrong key!\n&#34;,uVar16);
    (*_DAT_000130a4)(0);
  }
  FUN_004016a0(&#34;Here is your prize:\n\n\t%s\n&#34;,0xe8);
  (*_DAT_000130a4)(0);
}</code></pre>
<p>The hint here is the 0x35 which gives away the length of a hardcoded value. Apart of the code that was placed in the 0x90 nop section contains the byte array that is being used in the sequence:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/1843b7ac571454be.png"></p>
<p>The final value is:</p>
<pre><code>001DFDF0  7A 17 08 34 17 31 3B 25 5B 18 2E 3A 15 56 0E 11  z..4.1;%[..:.V..

001DFE20  40 08 0A 14 00</code></pre>
<p>It&#39;s then easy to determine the decoder key with the simple Xor:</p>
<pre><code>33 48 65 61 64 65 64 4d 6f 6e 6B 65 79 -&gt; 3HeadedMonkey</code></pre>

Hello,
I&#39;m working an incident response case for Derek Zoolander. He clicked a link and was infected with MugatuWare! As a result, his new headshot compilation GIF was encrypted. To secure an upcoming runway show, Derek needs this GIF decrypted; however, he refuses to pay the ransom. We received an additional encrypted GIF from an anonymous informant. The informant told us the GIF should help in our decryption efforts, but we were unable to figure it out. We&#39;re reaching out to you, our best malware analyst, in hopes that you can reverse engineer this malware and decrypt Derek&#39;s GIF.
I&#39;ve included a directory full of files containing:
MugatuWare malware
Ransom note (GIFtToDerek.txt)
Encrypted headshot GIF (best.gif.Mugatu)
Encrypted informant GIF (the_key_to_success_0000.gif.Mugatu)
Thanks, Roy

<h2 is-upgraded>Components of Ransomware</h2>
<p>Typically ransomware does a few tricks for anti-analysis and layered execution (hide shit in memory). Ransomware will also will create a ransom note, display a ransom note image to the user, and rename encrypted files.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Anti-Analysis</h2>
<p>One of the anti-analysis techniques is jumbling the IAT. The correct Windows API will resolve dynamically. You can choose to fix up the IAT or just continue to debug and fix up along the way. Luckily x32dbg will populate the right Windows API during runtime.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve summarized the functions that I chose to focus on:</p>
<p>1) 0x1cda WinMain</p>
<p>2) 0x1dad HTTP request to handle some twitter data, which you can patch to skip over. Nop out the branch at 0x1DB6:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/695d3100cb0367f3.png"></p>
<p>3) 0x166e Load Images from Resources</p>
<p>4) 0x1491 Call Virtual Protect and Run DLL entrypoint function</p>
<p>5) 0x1447 Get function offset from DLL exported function</p>
<p>6) @0x1e29 CreateThread pointing to the DLL exported function 0x1724</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Derelicte.dll</h2>
<p>In function 0x1491, a dll is loaded in memory but is fairly easy to carve out. Like the parent exe, the IAT of this dll is also jumbled so it&#39;s helpful to write down all the Windows API called dynamically.</p>
<p>Function 0x1229 recursively traverses the filesystem looking for folder <code>really, ridiculously good looking gifs</code>.</p>

<p>A few functions deep, the encrypt function is being called dynamically. It&#39;s highly suspicious when malware uses CreateFileMapping to do file manipulation in memory.  And the first 4 bytes of this string is used as a part of the key to encrypt the files.</p>

<h2 is-upgraded>The Decrypt Function</h2>
<p>I used this cute little image as a unit test. Just place a gif in the <code>really, ridiculously good looking gifs</code> folder so that you can verify your encrypt algorithm. It helps verify your decryption function.</p>

                ivar = (ivar - 0x61C88647) &amp; 0xFFFFFFFF

<p>Now the biggest hint that the <code>TODD</code> string gave is that the key is only 4 bytes long. Sometimes real ransomware will put hints into the encrypted filename. So the encrypted test image has this <code>0000</code> in the filename. Turns out this was the key in as in bytes: <code>0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00</code>.</p>

<p>The Flare team was nice enough to give you a hint for the final key in the best.gif image. Where <code>0x31</code> is the first byte in 4 byte array. From here on out you simple just need to bruteforce the last 3 bytes.</p>

<h2 is-upgraded>Identifying the Problem</h2>
<p>This was actually one of my favorite challenges this year. I remember doing the subleq challenge from flareon4 so I knew what to expect for this challenge. It&#39;s a simple x64 windows PE program that uses a blob of bytes as the intermediate language for the instructions. The only issue I had was finding the right language to code this up. Rust lang works really well with handling register-like math operations and it also had a nice library called <a href="https://docs.rs/crate/bigint/4.2.0" target="_blank">bigint</a> which made it easy to work with large integers.</p>
<p>The program sets up the memory space storing the instruction blob and generating a vtable that handles all the instruction AVX2 instructions.<img style="width: 624.00px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/d1bcbc17075b01a1.png"></p>
<p>Simple vtable:</p>

<p>These instructions use a set of 32 byte arrays as ways to store values. I used colors to help me visualize the locations :) :</p>
<img style="width: 596.00px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/ColorBytes.PNG">
<p>I was too lazy to code up every line so I just carved out the blob instructions to be processed as bytes in rust. Keep in mind is that all math operations have to convert the bytes for little endian.</p>

<p>The next function 0x1830 will process the program binary data be looping through the bytes. Every instruction has a set size for immediate values and math operations. One of the final instructions will compare one of the command line arguments post processed to <code>0x1ea1f3b229c845e81a861c08a82aa70a615ed201acb27070</code>. The other command line argument is actually given to you in the final function: <code>FLARE2019</code>.</p>

You&#39;re my only hope FLARE-On player! One of our developers was hacked and we&#39;re not sure what they took. We managed to set up a packet capture on the network once we found out but they were definitely already on the system. I think whatever they installed must be buggy - it looks like they crashed our developer box. We saved off the dump file but I can&#39;t make heads or tails of it - PLEASE HELP!!!!!!

<h2 is-upgraded>Extracting the Drivers</h2>
<p>Now to extract man.sys and FLARE_Loaded_0.</p>
<p>vol.py -f help.dmp --profile=Win7SP1x64 moddump -r man.sys --dump-dir ../tmp/</p>
<p>Output Error:</p>

<p>------------------ -------------------- ------</p>
<p>0xfffff880033bc000 man.sys              Error: e_magic 0000 is not a valid DOS signature.</p>
<p>So it seemed that this driver did not have a header. I didn&#39;t feel like extracting out the driver from the help.dmp file manually so I decided to modify volatility code instead. I traced the error to the function <code>get_nt_header</code>. It was just looking for a simple &#34;MZ&#34; to verify that it was an executable. So I just added this code to the function:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/ce88cec06195aeb0.png"></p>
<p>The next step was to rebuild the header of the driver, you can find the driver in memory or just copy an existing header and eyeball the section offsets. IDA should help you determine the driver entry function using it&#39;s FLIRT signatures.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>TCP Stream Filter Driver</h2>
<p>I was familiar with writing file system filter drivers but not TCP stream filter drivers. I used the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/blob/master/network/trans/stmedit/sys/StreamEdit.c" target="_blank">microsoft sample drivers</a> as reference so that I could follow along.</p>
<p>Basically the callout classify function handles the stream buffers.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/e813f144b0455589.png"></p>
<p>Stream encoding:</p>
<pre><code>let mut key7777 = vec![0x4a, 0x1f, 0x4b, 0x1c, 0xb0, 0xd8, 0x25, 0xc7];
while i &lt; encoded.len(){
        let blah = encoded[i] ^ key7777[i%8] &amp; 0xFF;
        out[i] = blah;
        i+=1;
    }</code></pre>
<p>It was easy to validate the decryption by looking for pool allocation tags in the help.dmp. I just used a hex editor to search for those.</p>
<pre><code>VirtualAddress = ExAllocatePoolWithTag((POOL_TYPE)0x200, *(_QWORD *)(argData + 0x60), &#39;RALF&#39;);</code></pre>
<p>The keys for each port were then easy to find in memory since the port preceded the key in hex:</p>
<p>Key for port 6666</p>
<pre><code>D5 69 94 FA 25 EC DF DA</code></pre>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 556.00px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/ccd35c862393c701.png"></p>
<p>Key for port 7777</p>
<pre><code>4a 1f 4b 1c b0 d8 25 c7</code></pre>
<p>Key for port 8888</p>
<pre><code>F7 8F 78 48 47 1A 44 9C</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Man.sys Driver</h2>
<p>This driver serves as the kernel agent. It basically handles all the commands delivered by the userland m.dll it loaded into svchost.exe. The biggest hint here was the validation it did for the PDB file. Every PDB file related had a similar path. You could then search for all the other dll files in the help.dmp file.</p>
<pre><code>e:\dropbox\dropbox\flareon_2019\code\cryptodll\objchk_win7_amd64\amd64\c.pdb</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Userland Agent Handler: m.dll </h2>
<p>I certainly got quite annoyed from decrypting all those RC4 encrypted strings. Luckily <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/" target="_blank">cyberchef</a> had a nifty tool to convert hex into bytes and then process those bytes into RC4. All the major Windows APIs and C std functions were dynamically loaded and executed. It was more tedious to reveal all those strings.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/bf99e7cf90ed9775.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>VAD Trees</h2>
<p>The reason why this challenge took so long, is that I forgot all about non-contiguous memory and Virtual Address Descriptor (VAD) trees. Luckily volatility has a command to dump these sections. Then all you need to do is find the memory dumps from svchost.</p>
<pre><code>vol.py -f help.dmp --profile=Win7SP1x64 vaddump -D vads</code></pre>
<p>svchost.exe.7e2a4b30.0x0000000000d50000-0x0000000000d52fff.dmp</p>
<p>svchost.exe.7e2a4b30.0x0000000000d60000-0x0000000000d62fff.dmp</p>
<p>svchost.exe.7e2a4b30.0x0000000000d80000-0x0000000000d85fff.dmp</p>
<p>...</p>

<h2 is-upgraded>Decrypting Traffic</h2>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/81321d6991718890.png"></p>
<p>Wireshark will allow you to dump TCP streams between 192.168.1.243 and 192.168.1.244. At first I wrote a simple PCAP parser program in rust because I originally thought every TCP packet was being modified instead of the stream. So I just ended dumping out all the streams by hand in wireshark which was no big deal.</p>
<p>First I started with decrypting the traffic on port 4444 which are the commands to the kernel agent. It was looking for a keepass kdb file. </p>

<p>I looked up the header file for KeePass versions and I was able to carve out a KDB file from the help.dmp file. However, I wasn&#39;t sure at the time that this was the same KDB. (It actually was).</p>
<ul>
<li>KeePass 1.x KDB File (this one):<br><code>03 D9 A2 9A 65 FB 4B B5</code></li>
<li>KeePass 2.x KDBX File:<br><code>03 D9 A2 9A 67 FB 4B B5</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The next traffic I decrypted was on port 7777. Here are the decrypted screenshots I actually cared about:</p>
<p>I thought this search was quite funny:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/72204ed4ef22ab4c.png"></p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/cb471e33ec5be44a.png"></p>
<p>At this point I was saddened that I had to find the master key from the keylogging output off of port 8888. So my next step was to decrypt the traffic for port 8888. The streams from the keylogger were using the LZNT1 and RC4 encryption from the crypto dll.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/a090919e2b0d3a13.png"></p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/7b5df95280ad3fdf.png"></p>
<p>So I plugged in that key which I thought was the masterkey and realized that the length of the key in the screenshot did not match the length of the keylogger output. I had to revisit the keylogger dll to see what was going on.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 400.50px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/e4f1c49c4826d4f5.png"></p>
<p>Turns out it was actually not using the shift keys for special characters, dropping any special characters like &#34;_&#34;, and only taking the lowercase version of the key.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/d6d6b30f9022584e.png"></p>
<p>I did a simple search in help.dmp for &#34;th3_&#34; and was able to partially find the key:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/d7292c79c8eadff6.png"></p>
<p>Master password was <code>Th!s_iS_th3_3Nd!!!</code></p>
<p>And the flag was <code>f0ll0w_th3_br34dcrumbs@flare-on.com</code></p>
<p>At this point I&#39;m so happy. Much relieved. My husband is glad I can stop talking about flareon6.</p>

        <p>My two favorite challenges this year as 11 &amp; 12. I felt like the clue giving was very sophisticated. Compared to the last time I played (flareon4), I felt that this year was a bit easier. However, I&#39;m very thankful that the Flare Team gives multiple weeks to finish these challenges. I only had a few hours each weekend and some time in the work week evenings to actually work on these challenges.</p>
<p>Thank you Flare Team, I very much enjoyed this year. <img style="width: 624.00px" src="../flareon6_2019/img/f51ad84d1e3c7324.png"></p>
